[![Bar la Marina, Torrevieja](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/07/bar-la-marina.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/07/bar-la-marina.jpg) Sometimes the first thing you see when you enter a city becomes one of your abiding memories of that place. Bar La Marina in Torrevieja is a building I've never been inside, but it's the first place we saw when we came up from the underground car park nearby. It's such an odd little building to find in a city like Torrevieja - a bungalow in a jungle of apartment blocks. Gleaming white walls with a rustic terracotta roof. It, along with the building across the road with the beautiful, ornate arches, is one of the first things I think of when I think of that city.
