[![Torrevieja tourist train, Spain](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/07/torrevieja-train.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/07/torrevieja-train.jpg) You can catch this little tourist train on the Paseo de la Libertad, just beside the markets in Torrevieja. It's incredibly cheap - costs about 2 Euro for an adult and 1 Euro for children - and it takes you right through the coastal part of the city right past Playa Los Locos. We usually arrived in Torrevieja around the hottest part of the day, and catching this little train with its covered roof was a fantastic way to do some sight-seeing while staying cool! At one point, we passed a group of cyclists while going up a hill, and the kids were _really_ pleased when one grabbed on to the side of the train and hitched a ride to the top!
