[![Torrevieja phone kiosk](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/07/torrevieja-telephone.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/07/torrevieja-telephone.jpg) When I'm in another country, I love to take the occasional photo of everyday things like phone boxes and ticket machines. They're so damned _foreign_. Like the stuff you might find here, but different. Different colours, and littered with a foreign language. Sometimes you're lucky if there's an English translation. I thought this bright blue phone box in Torrevieja would be an interesting match for my picture of rail ticket machines in Prague. Maybe if I travelled a bit more, I could make this into a whole series?
