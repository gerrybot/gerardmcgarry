[![Sagrado Corazon de Jesus](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/07/Sagrado-Corazon-de-Jesus.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/07/Sagrado-Corazon-de-Jesus.jpg) La Iglesia del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús (or Sacred Heart of Jesus church) is a strikingly modern building in the centre of Torrevieja. I nver got to investigate the interior, because we were on a fleeting trip through the plaza in which it's situated, but the building itself is gorgeous. I know I've gone on record before as [not being a fan of religion](http://gerardmcgarry.com/2009/an-atheists-approach-to-death/), but I do admire church architecture in a perverse way. On one hand, the level of inspiration that religion drives is fascinating to me. On the other, some of the oppulence found in churches scares me when a majority of believers are working class or worse. The stark white walls of La Iglesia del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús are dazzling in the midday sun - a beautiful sight in the middle of the sometimes sandy-coloured city of Torrevieja! If anyone has pictures of the interior, please share them with me and I'll publish them here!
