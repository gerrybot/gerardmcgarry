[![O'Connell Street, Dublin](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/08/oconnell-street-dublin.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/08/oconnell-street-dublin.jpg) A black and white photo of Dublin's O'Connell Street, with the Spire Of Dublin in the middle. The spire is also known as the Millennium Spike. On the left hand side can be seen the General Post Office, or GPO which was the scene of the Easter Rising in 1916. They say you can still see bullet marks from the skirmish, although I've never looked too closely! Slate magazine has [a great slideshow](http://www.slate.com/id/2173568/) about how the Spire came about and showing how it was errected.
