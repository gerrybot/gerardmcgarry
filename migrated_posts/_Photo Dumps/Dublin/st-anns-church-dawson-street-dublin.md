[![St Ann's Church, Dublin](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/08/Dublin-St-Anns-Church.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/08/Dublin-St-Anns-Church.jpg) Lisa and I took a couple of days off last week and went to Dublin. We did the shameless tourist thing and took one of those guided bus tours around the city. You may laugh, but it's a great way to get acquainted with the city _and_ you don't wear out your feet in the first few hours. This is a picture of St Ann's Church on Dawson Street. The point that was repeatedly hammered home on the tour was that it was the parish church of Mr Bram Stoker, who was born and raised in Dublin. It's a striking building, although what I've done here is to knock the stonework into straight black and white and slightly enhance the colours of the doors and passers-by.
