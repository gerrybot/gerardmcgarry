[![Guinness Storehouse tickets](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/08/guiness-storehouse.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/08/guiness-storehouse.jpg) I loved the design on these Guinness tickets, the fact that they sport some vintage Guinness adverts, and that each one is different. I don't know how many different versions are available, but considering they've got a couple of centuries worth of promo material, they shouldn't be running out of ideas anytime soon.
