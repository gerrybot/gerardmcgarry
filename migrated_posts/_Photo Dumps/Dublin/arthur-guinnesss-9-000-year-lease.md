[![Arthur Guinness's 9000 year lease](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/08/guinness-lease.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/08/guinness-lease.jpg) We took one of those tours around the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin. Since Guinness is a drink I passionately avoid, the reverence with which the brand is treated can be quite bemusing. However, it's fascinating to see how the Guinness identity has been developed over the years. Part of the lore of Guinness is the 9,000 year lease that Arthur Guinness signed for their premises at St James' Gate in Dublin. They say that he was so confident in his fledgling business that he happily signed the lease. Such confidence! Did Guinness _really_ foresee his business outlasting the Roman and Egyptian empires, Christianity, and most of recorded human civilisation, or was it simply standard form to make such ridiculously long leases back in the day? The original lease was signed on 31 December 1759, and this is on display at the Guinness Storehouse at St James' Gate, pictured above.
