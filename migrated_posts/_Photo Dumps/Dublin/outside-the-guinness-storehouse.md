[![Doors of the Guinness Storehouse](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/08/guiness-storehouse-doors.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/08/guiness-storehouse-doors.jpg) This was just before we took out tour of the Guinness Storehouse at St James' Gate. Once you go inside though, there's a cool effect where they have video in place of the old windows. As you're waiting in line, you see the silhouettes of workers going past and olde worlde carts and horses.
