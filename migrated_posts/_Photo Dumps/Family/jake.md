[![Jake](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/04/jake.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/04/jake.jpg) Back when Jake was a nipper, we took him up to Malone House for a fun day they were having. While Lisa got dragged off by Rachel for a spot of face painting I got left with Jake and the dog (dogs weren't allowed into the event because they had livestock). Anyhow, we were messing around on the grass, and I hit upon the snazzy idea of forming words out of the bits of twigs that were lying around. It didn't take too long to craft Jake's name out and then lie him down beside my handiwork for this photo - one of my all-time favourites! **Tip:** Use daisy heads to dot your "i"s.
