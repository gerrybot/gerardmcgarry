[![Kids at Benone beach](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/04/kids.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/04/kids.jpg) I asked them to pose 'nicely' for a photo. Between Rachel's expert bug-eye face and the boys mugging around in a squillion different ways, most of my photos from today's day out were unusable (or just reserved for laughing at privately in about 10 years). The only way to get them to pose seriously is to pretend you've stopped taking photos and drop the camera down. So, while they were giving their faces a break, I hit the button. And this is the result. That's [Mussenden Temple](http://gerardmcgarry.com/photo/mussenden-temple) in the background. I'm fascinated by this place now that I've seen it a couple of times.
