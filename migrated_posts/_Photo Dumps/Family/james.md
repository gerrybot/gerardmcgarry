[![James McGarry](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/08/chib.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/08/chib.jpg) Here's my old dad up at the top of Fair Head. We've gone up there a couple of times together. There's so much to see from the top of that cliff, and on a good day you'll catch the [rock climbers](http://www.fairheadclimbers.com/) scaling the face of it.
