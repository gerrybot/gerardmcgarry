[![A Level family portrait](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/04/a-level-portrait.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/04/a-level-portrait.jpg) I thought I'd share this painting I did during my A Levels - it's from a photo of my mother and sister sitting along the beack wall in Salthill in Galway. Memories of this are: struggling to work with the paint on the board, finding that my 'style' was a haphazard result of working with the paint blocks instead of skillful and on purpose. The hardest and last part of the picture to get right were my sister's trainers - in the photo they were white and I just couldn't make that work with the colours in the rest of the painting. So, in a fit of frustration, I remember mixing up this horrible green colour and painting the shoes with that. Mrs Johnston (who put up with _a lot_ from me during those two years) walked back into the room and declared the thing a raging success.
