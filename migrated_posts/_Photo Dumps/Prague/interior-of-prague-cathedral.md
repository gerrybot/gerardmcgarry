[![SONY DSC](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/03/inside-prague-cathedral.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/03/inside-prague-cathedral.jpg) This looks a little bit blurry, but it's a shot from the very back of the Cathedral looking toward the altar and the stained glass windows above. I did try to enhance the photo, but this is the best I could get.
