[![SONY DSC](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/03/st-vitus-inside.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/03/st-vitus-inside.jpg) This is a slightly more dramatic shot of the interior. The funny thing - if you can call it funny - is that you could only get a clear shot if you were looking up. The Cathedral was jam packed with tourists wandering around and it made it very difficult to get a clear shot. I don't remember it being this busy in the Vatican a couple of years ago. Eventually I got tired of taking shots. A combination of feeling bored, tired and antipathy toward _more_ church art. Of course I missed some great photo ops at the same time.
