[![Gargoyle](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/03/grotesque.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/03/grotesque.jpg) This twisted visage is one of the gargoyles that guards a doorway in St Vitus' Cathedral in Prague. I was surprised because it doesn't have the gothic intricacy of the other stonework in the building - the lines are much smoother and come across as fairly modern. Tim Burton _would_ be proud...
