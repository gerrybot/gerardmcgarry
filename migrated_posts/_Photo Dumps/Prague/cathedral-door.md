[![Cathedral Door, St. Vitus Cathedral, Prague](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/03/cathedral-door.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/03/cathedral-door.jpg) This is the inscription on the door of St Vitus' Cathedral in Prague. Apologies for colourising the image, but the original was slightly flat and grey. I was messing around with filters and techniques in GIMP and this was the end result. Whatever. I like it. I remember that our anti-communist tour guide relayed some shocking details about the Russian occupation in hushed tones just outside the door. Sometimes as a tourist, you go along to these places and soak up the atmosphere and the architecture and the people. But it takes a native to explain that Prague wasn't always a safe place for weekend vacations.
