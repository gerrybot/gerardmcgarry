[![SONY DSC](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/03/view-from-prague-castle.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/03/view-from-prague-castle.jpg) There's a lovely open space just before you go into the grounds of Prague Castle and in that space there's a wall that overlooks the city. It's such a beautiful vantage point and you can see red rooftops and spires stretching out into the endless distance. You can see a little ariel hovering above the cityscape in the left of this picture. It looks like a big television mast. In reality though, our tour guide told us that the same mast had been used to block communications coming into the city during the Russion occupation. This was the last day of our trip, and it was bitterly cold in Prague. Just up the road, I'd stopped for some mulled wine to heat me up from a little cafe. The sky was threatening rain at this point, but the cold was our worst enemy throughout the day.
