[![St. Vitus Cathedral](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/03/st-vitus-cathedral-side.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/03/st-vitus-cathedral-side.jpg) Here's a picture of St Vitus' Cathedral that I took from the courtyard. It's such an enormous building, and the other parts of Prague Castle are so cramped on top of it, you'd almost think it'd been airlifted in. Well, sort of.
