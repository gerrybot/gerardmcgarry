[![Church in Prague](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/03/church.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/03/church.jpg) This is what looks like a church building which is near to the Charles Bridge in Prague. From memory they were carrying out a Spanish guitar recital inside the day we were there. **Note to tourists with a Subway fetish**: Continue along the road to the left of the church building for about five minutes and you'll come across a Subway. If it's as cold in Prague as it was the day we were there, you'll need a coffee to get thawed out.
