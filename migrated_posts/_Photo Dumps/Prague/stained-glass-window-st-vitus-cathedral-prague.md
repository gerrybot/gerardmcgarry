[![Stained glass window in St Vitus' Cathedral, Prague](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/02/stained-glass-st-vitus.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/02/stained-glass-st-vitus.jpg) I took this picture of a stained glass window in St Vitus' Cathedral in Prague. At this point in the tour we were on, I was starting to get bored very quickly and stopped taking photos. There were just too many people milling around to get clear shots, and I ended up losing enthusiasm for the place. A shame, because our tour guide was excellent - a very wry communist hater who gave us a no-holds barred account of Russia's occupation of the country.
