[![Cesar Manrique's volcanic living room](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/07/manrique-volcanic-bubble.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/07/manrique-volcanic-bubble.jpg) The name **César Manrique** is hard to escape on the island of Lanzarote - a prolific artist, Manrique is responsible for much of the artistic heritage on the island - from being the designer of the wonderfully primitive logo for the Timanfaya National Park to creating a spectacular home out of five interconnected volcanic bubbles _under the ground_. This photo shows one of the underground rooms in Manrique's house - now the headquarters of the Fundación César Manrique - there's a notable absence of electronica, but as visitors to the site will see, Manrique used his amazing underground home for working on his art and for entertaining his friends. On the downside, some of the decor is somewhat dated - Manrique died in a car accident in 1992. However, it embodies his ideas about a symbiosis between art, design and the environment.
