[![Cannon barrel at Castillo San Gabriel, Lanzarote](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/07/cannon-barrel-san-gabriel.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/07/cannon-barrel-san-gabriel.jpg) I took a bit of a fancy for pictures of circles during our holiday in Lanzarote - something I might continue now that I'm home. This one's us looking down the barrel of the cannon outside [the Castillo de San Gabriel in Arrecife](http://gerardmcgarry.com/photo/castillo-de-san-gabriel-arrecife-lanzarote). Of course, Rachel decided to pop her face in at the very last minute, but I love how the inside of the cannon spirals downward toward the bottom.
