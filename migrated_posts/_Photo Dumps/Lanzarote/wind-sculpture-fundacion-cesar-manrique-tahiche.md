[![Wind Sculpture at Fundacion Cesar Manrique, Lanzarote](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/07/manrique-wind-sculpture.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/07/manrique-wind-sculpture.jpg) The kids pointing out one of César Manrique's eye-catching wind sculptures. The entire island of Lanzarote is littered in these brightly-coloured and unique creations. You'll find them mostly along the island's roundabouts - nodding, bobbing and twirling in the notoriously high winds that Lanzarote attracts! Suffice to say, this colourful construction isn't even the most marvellous of Manrique's wind sculptures - a nearby roundabout features a series of metallic 'bird-cages' that rotate and spin all day long. To the north of the island there's a sculpture with red funnels on the end that rises and falls all day long.
