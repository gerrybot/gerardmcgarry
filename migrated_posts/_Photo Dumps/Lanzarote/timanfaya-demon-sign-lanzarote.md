[![Demon sign at Timanfaya](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/07/timanfaya-sign.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/07/timanfaya-sign.jpg) The Cesar Manrique-designed insignia for the Timanfaya National Park in Lanzarote. Okay, I think the positioning of the tail looks a wee tad phallic if we're honest, but the demon shows some of Manrique's slightly primitive design style. As for the park itself, it takes up almost a quarter of Lanzarote, fields upon fields of lava and craters. If you're lucky, you'll see lines of camels walking through the rough ground, led by guides.
