[![Silhouette of Dunluce Castle at Sunset](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/11/dunluce-castle-sunset.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/11/dunluce-castle-sunset.jpg) A photo of **Dunluce Castle** and the coastline beyond at sunset on 1st November 2011. I've been wanting for years to capture this iconic image (the 'concept' of the castle at nightfall - not my actual picture - I'm not _that_ conceited) and I finally managed it at the end of a wonderful day trip with the children. There seemed to be a lot of amateur photographers taking shots of Dunluce from the roadside, but from my perspective, that angle didn't give the contrast against the skyline that I was looking for. So, Jake (my 8 year old) and I hopped the wall and waded into a _very_ mucky field to get the shot I wanted. And I'm glad I did. I just wish I was a better photographer, because I'm sure I could have captured a far more dramatic image if I actually knew what I was doing! Still, it was worth the muddy boots - and the fact that Jake and I got chased out of the field by five curious cows!
