[![Miniature model railway in Bangor](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/04/nir.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/04/nir.jpg) We took a little trip to Bangor at the weekend where one of the guys from work was involved in a model railway event. I went down to show a bit of support and take some pictures. These are a couple of reproduction trains, models that are still on the lines in Northern Ireland today. Probably one of the best photos I got on the day, thanks to the kids rushing through at breakneck speed.
