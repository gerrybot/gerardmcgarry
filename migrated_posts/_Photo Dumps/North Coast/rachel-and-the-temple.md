[![Rachel at Mussenden Temple](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/04/rachel-temple.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/04/rachel-temple.jpg) This one was Rachel's idea - she'd suggested that I stand with my hand out like I was holding [Mussenden Temple](http://gerardmcgarry.com/photo/mussenden-temple) in the palm of my hand. She took the picture of me, so I offered to do the same for her. She's a bit blurred (I must've been messing with the manual focus), but was happy enough with how it turned out, because she appears to be looking at the Temple - even though it was behind her!
