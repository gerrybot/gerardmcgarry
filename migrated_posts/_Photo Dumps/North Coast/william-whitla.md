For me, Whitla's name is inextricably linked to Queen’s - Whitla Hall was the first place I went to when I was matriculating (I think), I’ve taken exams there, and it was where I eventually received my degree in 1999. I bet if you’ve been to Queen’s, you’ve probably never paid much attention to Whitla. So, in the interests of research, here’s very thorough [biography of the man](http://www.ums.ac.uk/whitla_w.html).
