[![Mussenden Temple and train tunnel](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/04/mussenden-temple_0.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/04/mussenden-temple_0.jpg) Last shot of [Mussenden Temple](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/2009/mussenden-temple/ "Mussenden Temple"), I promise! This one should give you an impression of how the temple dominates the scene at Benone strand. We spent hours there today, and your eye is constantly drawn to this magnificent monument. It's a gorgeous place to spend time, and a much needed break after a tough week.
