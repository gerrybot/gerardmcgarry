[![Sail boat at Benone Strand in Northern Ireland](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/04/sailing-benone.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/04/sailing-benone.jpg) A sail boat passes by Benone Strand, near Mussenden Temple. Taken while out with the kids for the day - a really beautiful day out: fantastic weather, a relatively quiet beach and lots of splashing about in the water.
