[![Tides at the Giant's Causeway](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/03/causeway-tides.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/03/causeway-tides.jpg) I caught this shot late in the evening at the [Giant's Causeway](http://thenorthernirelandguide.co.uk/giants-causeway-and-legend-finn-mccool)Â this weekend. No, there's no distinctive 'causeway' landmark in this picture, but I loved how the waves were breaking on the rocks that evening. We took a good long walk right across the cliff path, which is well worth doing. I'd say the best of the scenery at the Giant's Causeway isn't actually at the well-worn rocks. It's actually quite disappointing looking at the main area, because rock slides and visitors clambering around have led to a lot of unsightly rubble lying around. Take a walk along the cliff path towards Dunseverick and you'll see some incredible scenery, largely untouched because only hardcore cliff walkers seem to venture in that direction. Trust me, though, there's a big payoff in taking a few hours to walk that path.
