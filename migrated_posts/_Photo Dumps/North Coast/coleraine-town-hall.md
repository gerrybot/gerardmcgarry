[![Coleraine Town Hall](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/12/coleraine-town-hall.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/12/coleraine-town-hall.jpg) Coleraine Town Hall is the centerpiece of the town. And you thought it was Moore's! I took this shot a while back, and it's one of my favourites for just being nice and clear and straighforward. A bit of info about the town hall -

> The new Town Hall was completed in 1859, architect Thomas Turner, builders MacLaughlin and Harvey, cost £4,146.19s.10 1/2d.(over £1000 beyond the estimate). The building is one of Turner's major works and bears strong similarities to the Northern Bank, Shipquay Place, Londonderry. Built of warm golden sandstone, it is in a restrained Italianate style.

I love the fact that council projects were going over budget even back then!
