[![Lanyon Building, Queen's University Belfast](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/04/lanyon-building.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/04/lanyon-building.jpg) Named after its architect, Charles Lanyon, the Lanyon Building is the focal center of Queen's University. Lanyon's work is scattered all over Northern Ireland. You travel to the North Coast, and the magnificent Glendun Viaduct is his work. As was the coast road round to Larne. Before that route opened up, that part of County Antrim was pretty remote and wild. Some say it still is. The Palm House in Botanic Gardens was Lanyon's design. He was the man who planted 1,500 trees on the Frosses Road to build a road between Ballymoney and Ballymena. However, he'll probably remain best known for the Victorian building with the postcode BT7 1NN which sees thousands of students file through its doors every day of the academic year.
