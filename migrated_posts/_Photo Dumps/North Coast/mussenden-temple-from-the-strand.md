[![Mussenden Temple and Benone Strand](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/04/mussenden-strand.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/04/mussenden-strand.jpg) We went back to Benone strand today and took some more shots of [Mussenden Temple](http://gerardmcgarry.com/photo/mussenden-temple) from the strand. You already know that the temple sits on the edge of the cliff face, but there's also a railway tunnel that cuts through the rock face.
