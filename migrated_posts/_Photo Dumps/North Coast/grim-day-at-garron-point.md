[![Grim day at Garron Point](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/08/grim-day.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/08/grim-day.jpg) **9th August 2008** \- A seriously grim day at Garron Point. Thunder storms, torrential rain, and one of the hairiest drives from Waterfoot to Ballycastle I've personally experienced. The Glendun Viaduct was actually flooded _on top of the bridge_, and we had to ease the car through in first gear. The Vanishing Lake was full to the brim, and the little hill completely covered save for the piles of stones that peeked above the water line.
