[![The Arcadia, Portrush, Northern Ireland](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2012/03/portrush-arcadia.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2012/03/portrush-arcadia.jpg) A bleak, desaturated shot of **The Arcadia** in Portrush. The building sits out on an outcrop on the beach and was once an old dancehall where showbands played. It's been given a lovely facelift in the last decade, but today was a particularly grim day in Portrush, and the Arcadia looked abandoned and dark.
