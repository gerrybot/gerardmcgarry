[![Windows on the world](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/08/windows-over-the-world.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/08/windows-over-the-world.jpg) A picture from the inside of [Mussenden Temple](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/2009/mussenden-temple/ "Mussenden Temple") in Londonderry, looking out over Downhill Beach from the window. The silhouettes are my daughter and a little friend who wandered into the shot. I just love the way they're both looking outward over the coast.
