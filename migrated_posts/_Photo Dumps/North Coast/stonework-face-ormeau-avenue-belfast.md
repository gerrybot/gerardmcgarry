[![Stonework face, Ormeau Avenue](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2012/02/stonework-face.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2012/02/stonework-face.jpg) It's not often that I share my Instagram shots on the photoblog here, but I'm quite pleased with the effect here. The stone face is above a doorway on Belfast's Ormeau Avenue. I thought it would be good to take the shot from below looking up. After I took the shot, I used Instagram's Inkwell filter to make it monochrome and a touch of a tilt-shift effect to set the focus on the face in the center.
