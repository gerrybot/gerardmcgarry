[![Grey Man's Path, Fair Head, Ballycastle](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/03/grey-mans-path.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/03/grey-mans-path.jpg) The Grey Man's Path is a steep ravine that runs from the top of Fair Head down to the shore. I wasn't aware of it until I saw a vintage photo a few years ago, so I decided to find the place and take my own picture. The horizontal ledge is where one of the crags from the cliff has fallen over and wedged across the path. If you ever get a chance to visit this place, the way in which this rock has fallen is truly remarkable. It doesn't seem to have been 'placed' across, but actually to have fallen and created this natural doorway.
