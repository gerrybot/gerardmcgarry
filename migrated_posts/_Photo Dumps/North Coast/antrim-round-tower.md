> The Round Tower and Bullaun Stone are impressive reminders of Antrimâ€™s ancient monastic settlement. The tower was built around the 10th century as a bell-tower for protection from raiders and is known locally as The Steeple. It is 28 metres tall and is one of the finest of its kind in Ireland. The monastic site was burned in 1147.

I took this one a few years back after spending an afternoon wandering around Antrim looking at it's historical landmarks. I think this round tower (along with the round tower at Devenish Island) is one of only two full-sized round towers remaining in Northern Ireland.
