[![Shipyards in Belfast - Thompson Graving Dock](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/12/shipyards-belfast.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/12/shipyards-belfast.jpg) Here's another shot taken down at the Thompson Graving Dock in Belfast. In this picture, we're looking back toward the city and one of the Harland and Wolff cranes towers over some of the modern office buildings that encircle the old dock. Just like the last image, I desaturated most of the picture, leaving the yellow of the crane (later fixed up using levels). I created a new layer and painted down the reflection of the puddle using a soft brush and a rainbow of colours. There are other ways to achieve this, but I wanted to do it manually. Once I'd finished painting this in, I applied a gaussian blur to the paint to get a smoother finish. I then set the layer to overlay and _voila_, instant magic.
