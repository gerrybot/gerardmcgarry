[![Sacred Heart Church, Omagh](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/12/sacred-heart-omagh.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/12/sacred-heart-omagh.jpg) A photo of Sacred Heart Church in Omagh - we spent some time there a couple of years back and I got this picture. I've given it a slight boost in Photoshop. Here's a bit more information about the church:

> This church was designed by William Hague and dedicated by Cardinal Logue in 1899, was built on the highest point in the town, replacing the old chapel of St Peter and St Paul built in Brook Street in 1829. The Rose Window with the High Altar below was provided by parishioners, who had emigrated to New York, as a memorial to the late Archbishop Hughes, first Archbishop of St Patrickâ€™s Cathedral, New York. It has been recently re-furbished.
