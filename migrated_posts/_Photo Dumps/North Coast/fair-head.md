[![View on Fair Head, Ballycastle](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/04/fairhead.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/04/fairhead.jpg) If you ever travel to Fair Head, the cliff which overlooks Ballycastle, this is the kind of view you can expect. In the distance is Knocklayde, and to the left is one of the shimmering lakes that are hidden at the top of the cliff. Looking down to the sea at roughly the middle of the picture, too far away to see clearly, the town of Ballycastle is nestled. Out of frame (far to the right of the picture) is Rathlin Island. I'm telling you, there's nothing like being on top of Fair Head for a bit of serenity. It's virtually untouched, rarely visited except by other die-hards who'll exchange a few pleasantries with you before hiking on their way. The wind at the top can be fierce at times - it certainly was that day - but so exhilerating that it just makes the experience even better. Since venturing up there a few years ago, it's become one of my favourite places to go and just walk and be at peace for a while.
