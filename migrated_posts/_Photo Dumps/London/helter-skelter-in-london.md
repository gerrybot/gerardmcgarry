[![Helter Skelter on London's south bank](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/04/helter-skelter-london_0.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/04/helter-skelter-london_0.jpg) We spent a majestic (no pun on the upcoming royal wedding) weekend in London over Easter, cramped up in Oonagh's one-bedroom apartment with the kids. The photo above is from the mini-carnival at E4's Udderbelly area on London's South Bank - it's been _years_Â (and years, and years) since I was on a helter skelter, but because Dan is slightly too small, they insisted that an adult accompany him. And...because Jake got a little freaked out up at the top of the helter skelter, I had to go up and \*ahem\* rescue him! Yep, an extra free ride for me! The downside being a couple of friction burns from when my legs rubbed against the side on the way down.
