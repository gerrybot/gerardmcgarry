[![Women of War Monument, London](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/08/women-of-war.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/08/women-of-war.jpg) In 2005, Queen Elizabeth II unveiled this sculpture by John W Mills dedicated to the effort of women in the second World War. The sculpture stands in Whitehall in London north of the Cenotaph.

> The lettering on the sides replicates the typeface used on war time ration books. There are 17 individual sets of clothing and uniforms around the sides, symbolising the hundreds of different jobs women undertook in World War II and then gave back for the homecoming men at the end of the war.
