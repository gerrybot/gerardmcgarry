[![London Red Telephone Boxes](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/04/london-phone-boxes.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/04/london-phone-boxes.jpg) A slightly doctored photo of four red telephone boxes at the lower end of The Strand in London, close to [Trafalgar Square](http://gerardmcgarry.com/photo/trafalgar-square). If you've ever seen the photography on sale in Covent Garden, they have these spectacular black and white prints where the reds of buses, phone boxes and postboxes are the only splash of colour on the canvas.
