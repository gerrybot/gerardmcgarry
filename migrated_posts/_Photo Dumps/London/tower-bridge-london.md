[![Tower Bridge, London](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/03/tower-bridge_0.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/03/tower-bridge_0.jpg) This is a shot from a perfect day I had in London a few years ago. I was over at a legal IT conference and had a bit of spare time in the afternoon, so I went for a walk around. I think it was a March or a May day, and the sun was beating down on the City. I discovered a footpath that runs along the Thames from London Bridge over to Tower Bridge, and this is a picture of Tower Bridge taken from along that path.
