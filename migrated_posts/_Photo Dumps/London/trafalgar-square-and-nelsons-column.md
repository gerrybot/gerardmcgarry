[![Trafalgar Square and Nelson's Column, London](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/12/trafalgar-square-london_0.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/12/trafalgar-square-london_0.jpg) This is a photo of Trafalgar Square taken from the entrance to the [National Gallery](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/2009/the-national-gallery-london/ "The National Gallery, London"). It's a fantastic vantage point, showing you from Nelson's Column all the way down Whitehall to Big Ben. I took the photo Easter 2009 during a visit to London with the kids. Funny, this is the one area of London I gravitate to whenever I'm in the city. I remember drunken stumbles down by Embankment tube station, and afternoons meandering through the National Gallery. The square was originally to be called King William the Fourth's Square, until George Ledwell Taylor suggested the snappier title of Trafalgar Square. It was built to commemorate the Battle of Trafalgar - work commenced in the 1820's and was completed in 1845.
