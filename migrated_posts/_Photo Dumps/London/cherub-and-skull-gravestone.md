[![Cherub and Skull gravestone from St Martin's crypt](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/01/cherub-skull-gravestone2.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/01/cherub-skull-gravestone2.jpg) Another photo from the crypt at St Martin In The Fields - this one's an ornate gravestone from 1670. I love these things, as morbid as they are - cherub at the top and a sinister skull at the bottom. They really don't make them like this anymore.
