[![British Museum](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/09/british-museum.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/09/british-museum.jpg) I was in love with this place from the moment I saw a picture of it last year - the Great Court of the British Museum. And I knew that one day I just had to see it. It's what used to be a standard courtyard which became used as space for the British Library until the library relocated, freeing up the area for development. What you have now is a glorious glass dome which encompasses the entire area, and a marbled court for simply milling about and admiring the architecture. The cylindrical reading tower in the middle has steps to a restaurant at the top, and you can have a rare opportunity to see the top of the enormous columns on the galleries opposite. I've got a few more photos which I'll post when I get a moment or two.
