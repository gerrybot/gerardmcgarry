[![St Paul's Cathedral, London at night](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2012/02/st-pauls-cathedral-unbrande.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2012/02/st-pauls-cathedral-unbrande.jpg) It's not often I include my iPhone footage when updating my photoblog, but I _had_ to include this shot of **[St. Paul's Cathedral](http://www.stpauls.co.uk/)** at night. The shot was taken during a freezing cold walk along the Thames in early January 2012, and was taken from the far side of the Millennium Bridge, giving two lovely lines of light leading to the magnificent dome of St. Paul's in the distance. Unfortunately, there was much camera noise (I'm resolutely blaming the iPhone here), and so there was a fair bit of post-processing to remove the graininess in the photo. However, I'm happy with the result. I'd love to revisit this someday with a proper DSLR and tripod in tow and try for something a little bit better!
