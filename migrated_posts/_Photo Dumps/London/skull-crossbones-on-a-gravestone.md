[![Skull & Crossbones stone in St Martin's crypt London](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/01/st-martin-skull-crossbones.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/01/st-martin-skull-crossbones.jpg) This'll be the first photo post from our trip to London last week. Lisa and I found ourselves with a bit of time before our flight home, and we wandered into the crypt at St Martin In The Fields (just [beside Trafalgar Square](http://gerardmcgarry.com/photo/trafalgar-square)). While there's not an awful lot to see - it's essentially a cafe these days - you do have to walk over ancient gravestones as you pass through. This one stands out for the chilling skull and crossbones, as well as for the details - the shovel and pickaxe either side are great. I wonder if there's a deeper meaning to them than representing the gravedigging process?
