[![London: White Tower at the Tower Of London](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/12/white-tower-close.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/12/white-tower-close.jpg) A shot of the side of the Tower Of London's White Tower. I took this one when we were in London back in Easter 2008 - I never really got a chance to upload some of these at the time. Since we're going to London again in a couple of weeks, I'm hoping to build up my portfolio of photos of the city. I think I've fallen in love with London again.
