[![Trafalgar Square, London](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/09/trafalgar-square.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/09/trafalgar-square.jpg) Had a lovely walk around London on Monday (again). Unfortunately, the National Gallery doesn't actually open until 10am, so while loitering around Trafalgar Square I took a few photos. This one looks over one of the fountains, past the statue of King George IV and up to St Martin In The Fields church
