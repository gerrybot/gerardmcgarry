[![Thatched cottage rectory at Cultra](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/11/cultra-thatched-cottage.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/11/cultra-thatched-cottage.jpg) This quaint thatched cottage is a former rectory that's been a part of the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum for as long as I can remember. According to estimates based on the tree growth rings inside the house, it was originally built in 1717. The rectory was originally sited in Toomebridge, Co. Antrim. I'm incredibly pleased with the photo, which was taken this autumn on a clear, crisp November afternoon. The light on the thatched roof was just fantastic, as were the leaves on the nearby trees.
