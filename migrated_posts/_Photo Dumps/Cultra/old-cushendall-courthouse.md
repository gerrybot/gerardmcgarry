[![Old Cushendall Courthouse at Cultra](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/11/cultra-courthouse.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/11/cultra-courthouse.jpg)Built around 1858, the courthouse in the Ballycultra village was originally situated in Cushendall before being relocated to the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum. The courthouse is on the first floor of the building, but the archway underneath was used to hold markets. The museum has used the courthouse to great effect in the past - I remember one year a green-clad Santa Claus was tried for burglary in open court.
