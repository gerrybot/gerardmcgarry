[![My untimely demise in Ibiza](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/04/untimely-demise.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/04/untimely-demise.jpg) Every now and then, you get an opportunity to be photographed at the brink of death. There's a shot of me apparently hanging from a cliff edge that's quite convincing (I was standing on a fairly reliable outcrop at the time). I came across this shot, taken on holiday in Ibiza. I remember seeing the huge flight of steps and asking Lisa to go to the top and take a photo. By the time she got there and turned around to take the shot, I was lying on the ground. Having not explained my intentions beforehand, she assumed I'd fallen over or something, so we had this shouted conversation where I explained that I wanted her shot to make it look like I'd just fallen down a flight of steps. And this is the end result. I really like the idea of doing a series of gory near-death photos though: very Alice Cooper!
