[![Flight of the Earls scuplture, Ramelton](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/03/flight-of-the-dancing-earls.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2008/03/flight-of-the-dancing-earls.jpg) Down on the beach in the town of Rathmullan, there's a sculpture of three large figures on a ramp and a raggedy gaggle of emaciated peasants imploring them to come back. Yes, it's the legendary Flight Of The Earls. Except this time, it's with added Jazz Hands. You may think I'm morally bankrupt. Well, I hold my (jazz) hands up to that. Come on! Everything about this pic screams ridiculous. It's the descending formation of the characters with their hands raised to the sky. The effect is compounded by the peasants in front of them. It's like someone poured liquid metal over the local amateur dramatic society.
