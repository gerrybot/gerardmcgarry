[![Halloween facepaint](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/10/gerard-halloween.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/10/gerard-halloween.jpg) Thought I'd share this one - on the morning of the kids' Halloween dress-up day at school, I decided to slap on a bit of make-up and join in the fun! I always love doing make-up around the eyes, which probably stems from my fascination with Alice Cooper when I was younger. A little bit of sponge work sorted out the cheekbone definition! You should have seen the stares as we walked the kids into school!
