[![Goofy face Halloween pumpkin](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/11/goofy-face-pumpkin.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/11/goofy-face-pumpkin.jpg) Only a fortnight after Halloween, and I'm finally getting around to posting this year's pumpkin photos. I carved this goofy faced one first - I love doing pumpkins with big, chunky teeth and crazy eyes. Normally we fill the pumpkin with paper after Halloween and set light to it (outdoors, of course) - it's fun to watch the flames billowing out the top, and when the paper blackens, it makes a brilliant backdrop for the eyes.
