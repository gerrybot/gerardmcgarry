[![Hanging tree pumpkin](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/11/hanging-tree-pumpkin.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/11/hanging-tree-pumpkin.jpg) This pumpkin is based on a design I found online - unfortunately it was a Google Image search, so I can't credit the original designer. I loved the intricacy of the branches. They present a real challenge to cut out without snapping parts off. If I was doing this again, I'd cut the hanging man separately and hang it from the branch with a piece of string. As a matter of fact, having seen some of the amazingly detailed designs online, I'd love to get some practise in carving some more complicated designs.
