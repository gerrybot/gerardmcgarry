[![Spongebob Squarepants pumpkin](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/10/pumpkin-spongebob.jpg "Spongebob Squarepants pumpkin")](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/10/pumpkin-spongebob.jpg) I asked my daughter what she'd like to see on the first pumpkin I carved this year. And out of an almost limitless stock of gore and spooky images, what did she choose? Spongebob Squarepants, her idol, moral guide and favourite person/sponge ever. It was actually a little more difficult to carve than your usual pumpkin, but it came through in the end without falling apart.
