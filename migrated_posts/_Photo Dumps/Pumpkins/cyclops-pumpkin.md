[![Cyclops Pumpkin](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/10/cyclops-pumpkin.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/10/cyclops-pumpkin.jpg) OK, this is my favourite pumpkin from this year's batch so far - the cyclops. I'd have preferred a taller pumpkin to work this on, but I'm fairly pleased with the result, especially the carved teeth.
