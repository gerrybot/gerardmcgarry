I finally tipped the scales with my music blog yesterday. We've been edging toward 4,000 pageviews on Unreality Music over the last month and after coming close a few times, finally tipped the scales yesterday.

That's a milestone for the blog and I'll set my sights now on achieving 5,000 pageviews per day. Hopefully within the next month.

Competition
-----------

The music news niche is notoriously hard to crack - there are many big, established websites covering everything. Then there are innumerable smaller niche blogs and sites covering certain artists and genres. (I came across [Brown Sista](http://brownsista.com/) today BTW, which is a great name)

The music blog had a particularly hard time recently when it was unexpectedly (and inexplicably) penalised by Google. Referrals from Google fell away to nothing for a couple of months - we don't do anything spammy, so it was a shock to lose traffic so drastically - especially when the rest of the site was still doing so well.

Writing Challenges
------------------

Unreality Music has been live for about 9 months, and one of the biggest challenges has been finding my voice on that blog.

I don't like parroting the music news like other sites do, and I found that my taste for older rock and metal music were hampering what I was qualified to write about.

Having said that, I'm pretty much current with celebrity news and what's going on in music, so I decided to work out what I wanted the blog to be by working out my goals.

Defining Goals
--------------

I wanted Unreality Music to be a fun place for people to discover music news and new songs. To that end, I try to cover current music news, and to let my readers know what new releases are on the horizon. Here are some of my defined goals:

*   **Not just repeating the news**: You can get music news anywhere - the unique selling point of my music blog is that you'll **always get an opinion**, and I'll try to make it funny.
*   **I won't write about everything**: I'm just one guy, and I haven't got unlimited time, so I'll cherry pick stories, songs and bands that I want to write about.
*   **I will link out wherever possible**: I _hate_ those walled garden sites where they only ever link to their own stuff. I'll link you to the artist's homepage and any other good writing I find. I will **never link to** walled gardens like Digital Spy or sites that ignore the rest of the Internet. Those old-media sites don't deserve links if they won't give links.
*   **I will try to promote unsigned acts**: I'm not a music mogul - yet. But if I can make a difference, I'll write about musicians I find on MySpace and Virb.com where I can. There's a lot of good music out there that never makes the charts, and I'd like to be helping people to find it!
*   **Increasing readership**: I love watching my RSS subscribers rise. It shows that people appreciate my writing and want to come back for more. I think as my confidence as a writer has grown (recently) there's been a marked increase in subscribers.

Anyway, there's a random post about blogging for you. I'll be working on ways to increase readership over the next twelve months, and I think it'll be interesting to see how various promotional techniques work out.

It's early evening here and I've almost reached my 4,000 pageviews already, so I know I'm doing something right!
