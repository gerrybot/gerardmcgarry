Haven't posted here in a while, but there's a lot of good stuff going on with Unreality TV and I wanted to share it here.

**Unified Themes**

Since we decided to launch companion blogs to Unreality TV, we decided to create a professional template, which you can see at [Unreality Music](http://music.unrealitytv.co.uk "Unreality Music"). Over the coming weeks, the entire site will be unified with this theme. I think it's one of the most professional I've ever designed, with a little help from the guys who wrote the [Sandbox theme for WordPress](http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/).

**New Blogs**

We've been working on the music blog for a while, and we'll be putting together the Primetime blog very soon. I want to get down to blogging a bit more as well, since it's what piqued my renewed interest in blogging again! The music blog will be my big thing, and I want to cover unsigned acts as well as mainstream music. those visitors who come for mainstream music will discover some interesting new acts!

**New Advertisers**

We've been trying a couple of different new advertising schemes which are yielding great results. I'm glad they're doing so well. I'll maybe cover these in a future post.
