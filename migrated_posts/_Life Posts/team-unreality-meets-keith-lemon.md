[![Lisa and Gerard with Leigh Francis aka Keith Lemon](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/03/leigh-francis.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/03/leigh-francis.jpg) Last Sunday, Lisa and I visited the O2 Arena in London for a special X Factor concert for _The Sun_ readers. We were there at the invitation of some of our contacts and spent a fantastic afternoon mingling in a VIP box with other bloggers _and_ the "Voice Of The X Factor", Peter Dickson. By far the highlight of the visit was bumping into Keith Lemon (aka Leigh Francis) and getting our photos taken with him. It was a very brief meeting, but he's one of the funniest men on TV at the moment. I know I don't post many of these photos on my photoblog a) because I obviously didn't take this and b) because I don't like to appear in front of the camera. But I'll make an exception in this case! **PS.** I am _not_ drinking beer and wine at the same time!
