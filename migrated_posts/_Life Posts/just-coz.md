I can't blog right now, which is ironic considering that's exactly what I'm doing. I think I have the cursed writer's block, brought on by a general malaise about blogging in general, the quality of news reporting and the full-on futility of blogging for money.

1.  **Blogging's Changed**. Everywhere you look these days, people are hoping to make money from their blogs. It used to be all about conversation, not the whole thing's tainted with people trying to milk it for cash. I'm trying to reconcile making money from websites with starting interesting conversations about things I love.
2.  **Quality Of Reporting**. Some news outlets will print anything to avoid missing out on a story. Most news these days seems to be pure regurgitation. Watch a story appear on one site and slowly spread across other news sites throughout the day. It's so boring. I've tried to do the re-reporting thing, but it just doesn't work for me. Personally, I think it's squeezing the will to write out of me.
3.  **Blogging For Money**. I used to religiously check AdSense and other earning stats, but I'm slowly weaning off that trend. Online earnings - unless it's product related - are virtually worthless for the majority of bloggers. Partly to do with poor revenue streams, partly to do with the difficulty of gaining market and mindshare. The little guy just can't get to prominence, no matter how good he/she is.

The other thing is, hang around webmasters and social media for any length of time, and you'll see some desperate people trying to get the pageviews, trying to promote their stuff, getting a quick spike of traffic for a lot of submissions. The one place online I've had the most fun recently is our forum at Unreality. It's got no AdSense, and focusses on a sweet bunch of people coming together to talk about the entertainment stuff we all love. There's no pressure to earn in there, just conversation and connections. So, as far as my blogging goes, I want to find a away to emulate that. I want to create conversations, not re-vomit the news. If I was a soulless robot, I could easily trot out keyword-laden news articles and beat most of the press. **If I wanted to.** This stream of consciousness was brought to you by a desperate need to reinvent a blog and to blaze a new trail in blogging. Thanks for tuning in.
