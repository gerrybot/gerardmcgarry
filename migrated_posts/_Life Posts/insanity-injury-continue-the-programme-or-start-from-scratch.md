![Image](http://gerard.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/bodycast.jpg?w=275)Ouch. Somewhere in between all that squatting, thrusting and mad crazy leaping into the air plyometric stuff, my back has decided to complain. Loudly. **One week of Insanity** and I'm already injured!

At the end of last week, I reluctantly decided to stop exercising. I'd pulled something at the top of my inner thigh/groin, and my back was starting to grumble about five days of intense back-to-back workouts.

Today, my back is still stiff and sore. Part of me is tempted to do a Plyometric Cardio routine and see if this loosens things up. It probably won't, though, meaning a few days of Ibuprofen and frustration about breaking the flow of the Insanity programme.

Which brings me to my question for you guys: When I'm fit enough to exercise again, do I

1.  Restart the Insanity programme from scratch, or
2.  Simply pick it up again from where I left off?

Restarting the programme gives me the benefit of doing all Insanity in one block. Presumably there are important benefits to following the full 60-day programme? Picking it up from where I left off would mean less to do, which means I'd finish Insanity quicker.

Which would _you_ do?
