![Insanity Pack Shot](http://gerard.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/insanity-packshot.jpg?w=300 "Insanity Pack Shot")Hola, Insane amigos! Today's round of [**Insanity**](http://gerard.wordpress.com/2012/04/16/beachbody-insanity-day-1-the-fit-test/ "Beachbody Insanity, Day 1: The Fit Test") was one that even the formidable Shaun T said he was nervous about. _Pure Cardio_ is a fast-paced round of exercise that's made a fair bit harder because there are virtually **no rest breaks** during the routine. You stop as normal after the warm-up and stretching routines, but when the workout starts, you're riding the rollercoaster right to the end! On this fifth day, many of the moves in the warm-up, stretches and workout itself are becoming familiar - the suicide drills and 'level 2' routines are all starting to seem familiar. Which is good, because most of the workouts we've done in this first week are repeated over the next four weeks. That should address a lot of my concerns about form, which I feel is important... 

1.  To get the absolute most out of every workout. No point in doing Insanity if I'm not going to get every benefit from it.
2.  To avoid injury. Bad form puts stress on muscles and joints and leads to PAIN!  Nobody wants _that_ crap!

Pure Cardio
-----------

**Like I said,** the cardio routine was intense as expected. I found a lot of the going pretty tough - those rapid fire push-up/mountain climber moves are guaranteed to frag me every time, but I felt like I gave a solid effort. My one gripe as always was getting exhausted and stopping the DVD to go back and re-do parts. The goal from now on will be to rest less and push that little bit harder during every workout. On the plus side, there were spots during the workout today where I felt my energy returning and exercises that used to exhaust me gave me a new lease of life. The standing mountain climbers are a good example - I found a burst of energy got me through these. Still struggling with anything to do with push-ups, but slowly improving. You know what's good though? Watching the gym bunnies alongside Shaun T flagging under the pressure and occasionally having to sit out to recover. Shaun T himself collapses at the end, so you don't feel like such a pathetic mess by the end of the workout! **Note**: Laughed my ass off when Shaun started referring to himself in the third person: "Shaun T is tired now..." **Injuries**. Yes, injuries. I [mentioned in my Cardio Recovery post](http://gerard.wordpress.com/2012/04/20/beachbody-insanity-day-4-cardio-recovery/ "Beachbody Insanity, Day 4: Cardio Recovery") that I'd ended up with a sore back yesterday. I was reluctant to start the routine today, but decided to push on and see how it went. And it went pretty well. The back injury didn't hinder me, but during the workout I felt a worrying pain in my inner thigh up near my groin. It was particularly harsh during the push-up jacks. I'm hoping that it'll have eased off before Day 6 in case I have to reconsider doing the Insanity programme or take a break for a few days to recover properly.

Diet break
----------

I'm not following the Insanity eating programme. That would be too disruptive to home life, and too much of a learning curve. I _am_ however, eating well, staying hydrated and getting lots of protein. **My question for you**: Do you allow yourself an 'off night' during the Insanity programme? One where you hit your local Chinese takeaway and pop open a bottle of red wine? I'd like to know what other people are doing...
