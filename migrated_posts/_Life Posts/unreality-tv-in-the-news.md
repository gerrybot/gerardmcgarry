Unreality TV has experienced some excellent coverage in the news recently as a result of the Jade Goody/Shilpa Shetty race row. Lisa's taken a lot of calls from radio stations, TV and newspapers looking for her take on the situation and to find out what our readers are saying.

The most interesting was earlier last week when she got an email in the early afternoon last week asking if she'd be available for an interview with Channel 4 news. Now, this turned out to be More 4, a Channel 4 sister channel - not just as mainstream/large audience share. But anyway, great to receive the call!

At first she wondered how they'd pull off an TV interview, with us living in Northern Ireland (the disadvantage of running a UK entertainment website like Unreality), but they arranged for studio time down at the UTV studio on the Ormeau Road. Lisa was less than amused at how the interview was conducted - the satellite feed was one way, so she was looking into a camera in an empty room as the voice of the interviewer came through the headset!

The media attention has given us greater hope for the site. Contrary to popular belief, press releases and mentions in the news don't have a massive effect on web traffic, at least not in the short term. We're hoping that the media exposure will make Unreality an established brand and perhaps the initial exposure will snowball. Who knows?

The last week has been an incredible learning curve for us, but a valuable one. Onward and upward!
