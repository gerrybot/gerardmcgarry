[Unreality TV](http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk "Unreality TV") has been going great guns for the last 6 months. SEOmoz (a huge Search Optimisation company in the US of A) recently published their monthly stats and I was overjoyed to discover we were whomping them month on month! I love the [SEOmoz blog](http://www.seomoz.org/), by the way. :) Anyway, we've been toying with other blogging ideas and the most likely at this juncture are blogs on music and regular telly. So let me introduce you to two of our works in progress:

1.  [Unreality Music](http://music.unrealitytv.co.uk/ "Unreality Music") \- Soon to be a place of music reviews of current tunes and past classics. I'll be taking the lead on the music blog, and I want it to feature not only established acts, but unsigned acts a la MySpace. We'll also be accepting guest reviews and contribution, particularly of recent gigs.
2.  [Unreality Primetime](http://primetime.unrealitytv.co.uk "Unreality Telly") \- Lisa's going to be taking the lead on this new blog, looking at other popular TV shows like The OC, Desperate Housewives, all that stuff. It'll be a much bigger blog than the reality TV one, but it's good to watch alternative shows too!

You can conclude from this that Lisa has definitely got square eyes. As do most of our readers! But we love them all and they love us back! There will be boards on the [Unreality Forum](http://forum.unrealitytv.co.uk "Unreality Forum") to support all of the new areas we're covering. We're excited about how the Unreality blogs are unfolding. We're going along to press conferences, working with production companies, getting 300,000+ eyeballs on our blog each month, not to mention the thousands of comments people have been compelled to leave for us and even for reality show contestants. These additional blogs will hopefully complement what we already have while creating a spot for people to discuss different types of music and television.
