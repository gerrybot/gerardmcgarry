I have decided, for no particular reason, that I'm going to limit myself in the titles I use on this blog.

OK, that's a lie, there are about three reasons I could give you for limiting my post titles:

1.  Because [Greg Storey](http://airbagindustries.com/) does it on his blog and it comes across as quirky and enigmatic.
2.  Because it ties in with my goal of performing as little Search Optimization on this blog as possible. It's almost as if I don't want an audience!
3.  Because I like the idea and discipline of boiling down the subject of each post to a single word. That's right, one word to explain what my latest missive will be.

Note that the concept of brevity does not and will not apply to the content of my posts, just to the titles.
