Well, today was my last day at Cleaver Fulton Rankin. I had worked there as IT Manager for almost 8 years. It would have been a full 8 years in September.

Leaving a job after such a long time is an odd feeling. On one hand, you've been there so long that being anywhere else seems alien. You're part of the furniture, one of the old-timers. On the other hand, there's something refreshing about a new start. All that history, years of developing a network and resolving problems, are at an end. A new challenge is on the horizon, new system, new people.

As a last day, it was pretty eventful. People in the office suddenly realising that they needed some piece of information before I went. Suppliers calling to wish me well and maintain some contact at the new firm. Colleagues stopping by to chat for a minute or two. Then there was a nice bit of server drama as the file server needed a reboot and we subsequently discovered it was reporting a disk failure.

Talk about testing closure to the limit! It's hard to walk away from a network that you've tended to for 8 years. But it had to be done.

So, I take a break tomorrow and spend a little time with the family. Hopefully we get the weather for a day out. Then it's off to the new job on Thursday, which I'm really looking forward to.

I did a site visit a few weeks ago and have a mental note of some of the areas that need attention, some things I need to know. But all in all, I'm looking forward to the experience. I'm not daunted or intimidated, just excited about being given a challenge to rise to. One thing I've realised over the last weeks at CFR is that the job wasn't challenging me anymore. I'm looking forward to changing that now.
