[![Drupal Logo](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/01/drupal-logo.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/01/drupal-logo.jpg)This is just a short note to say that I'm closing comments on this site for a little while. Over the last week or so, I've been deluged with spam, despite having Drupal's highly regarded [Mollom module](http://mollom.com) installed. I'm not going to bother fighting spammers by moderating comments constantly. Even when reporting spam comments to Mollom, the same stuff just keeps coming back: mostly Tiffany jewellry and Ugg boots spam. If I can't see the benefit of reporting spam to Mollom, then why bother? **What to do instead?** If you've found one of the tutorials or photos on this site useful and you have a website of your own, please drop me a link back. If you're commenting on something I've written, I'll pick up the response via Technorati, and it'll help other people to find my blog. I am available in other places on the web, like Unreality TV, Unreality Shout and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/unrealitytv). And of course, if you need to speak to me, use the "Get In Touch" link at the top of the page. **Update:** I was _genuinely_ surprised to see this post appear on Drupal Planet, but more than that, I was surprised to receive some direct messages from others. The overwhelming advice? To install the [Spamicide module](http://drupal.org/project/spamicide) for Drupal. It apparently sets a hidden field in forms. If the form is filled in by a bot, the module discards the comment. As they say, it won't protect from human spammers, but it'll kill of a lot of the robot-driven stuff! I'm giving it a test run tonight, and comments are reactivated (obviously).
