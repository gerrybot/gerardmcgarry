[![Firefox Logo](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/08/firefox-e1379623063857.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/08/firefox-e1379623063857.jpg)Firefox can be customised in many ways using the **about:config** URL. But sometimes, you may mistakenly enter a value or you may want to reverse an entry completely. However, if you've ever tried to delete a custom entry, you'll know there's no option labelled "delete". It's actually the "Reset" option you want to choose if you want to remove a custom entry. Here's how it's done:

1.  In your Firefox address bar, type **about:config** and hit enter. You'll see a standard warning about making changes to the config. Accept this to continue.
2.  Now, you need to find the entry you want to delete. Type a part of the entry name, and the list of settings should filter to reveal the one you want. Custom settings are usually highlighted in **bold type**.
3.  All you need to do now is right-click on the entry you want to delete and select **Reset**. If the setting is part of the core browser, it will be reset to the default value. However, if it was a setting you added, it will be deleted.
4.  Restart Firefox in order for the changes to take effect.
5.  If you like, you can check the changes by revisiting **about:config**.

Hope this helps a few people to get rid of old or troublesome customisations in Firefox. It's a lot more straightforward than resetting your profile!
