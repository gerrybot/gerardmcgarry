I notice that Dreamhost is [still having trouble](http://blog.dreamhost.com/2006/09/19/anatomy-of-a-disaster-part-2/) bouncing back from their recent network troubles. Reading the comments in their blog post, I was surprised by the number of people who were sticking up for the company on the strength of a couple of blog posts issued _after_ the disaster. Some folks seem oblivious to the fact that downtime of the sort Dreamhost has suffered recently is actually unacceptable. I wonder if some of these people are blog kiddies who don't appreciate the importance of uptime for a business website. Who ignore the issues of lost revenue and reputation an online business can face. Dreamhost _didn't_ deal with these issues in their blog post. Apparently belated openness will soothe the complaining customers!

Dreamhost Dropping Negative Comments
------------------------------------

The reason I'm writing this post is because I tried to post a comment on the blog today and received a message that I'd triggered a spam filter. Bizarre? You bet. No profanity in my post at all, no links, nothing that I can think would trigger a spam filter. Anyway, I've decided to repost my entire comment here, lest Dreamhost conveniently delete it from their filters instead of allowing free speech on the blog:

> I'm surprised at the immaturity of some of the people posting here. Attacking Karen for expressing her point of view is wrong - she has perfectly valid points. While I applaud Dreamhost for their blog updates, they've conveniently sidestepped the issue of compensation for business customers who've lost income through this downtime (and my sites were hit hard). And yes, there's a veiled admission of incompetence in this post that doesn't give much confidence in how the network will be rebuilt! There's a group of DH users running around with rose-tinted specs on when it comes to this! And you can make all the claims you like about 'getting what you pay for', but when I signed up I didn't see any warnings on the front door saying "Not suitable for business users" or "Unreliable uptime - non-critical sites only". I do hope you get the problems ironed out once and for all, but like others I'm shoping around.

**Update:** I actually forgot to post this a couple of weeks ago, but checking for my comment as detailed above I notice the _Happy Dreamhost Sneaky Comment Deleting Team_ have sneakily deleted my comment. So much for opening conversation in the blogosphere between customers and suppliers! What would Mr [Steve Rubel](http://www.micropersuasion.com/) have to say about _that_?
