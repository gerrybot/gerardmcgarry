Lifehacker has a post about [dragging unlinked URLs](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/firefox/firefox-quick-tip-drag-and-drop-url-text-225931.php) to the address bar to navigate. Let’s say you come across an URL that hasn’t been linked. Select it (careful with spaces at the start and end) and drag it up to the address bar. Release the mouse and FireFox will automagically jump to that page. In fact, you can even drag regular links to the address bar for the same effect.

Other FireFox Navigation Tricks & Techniques
--------------------------------------------

This got me thinking about other navigation tricks I wanted to share. Let’s try:

*   **ALT+HOME**: This shortcut will take you back to the browsers default homepage.
*   **Changing Your Default Homepage**: Drag a link from the address bar over the Home button. Release the mouse and you’ll be asked if you want to reset your homepage.
*   **ALT+D**: This jumps you straight into the address bar and allows you to either type in a new address or modify the address that’s already there.
*   **ALT+Back Arrow/ALT+Forward Arrow**: The essential Back/Forward browsing commands. Don’t leave home without them.
*   **CTRL+T**: Open up a new tab in your browser window. It’ll start up with the cursor in the address bar waiting on your command. Literally.
*   **CTRL+TAB**: Cycles through the various tabs you have open in FireFox. Bonus points for using CTRL+SHIFT+TAB to cycle backwards! Got too many tabs open? Then you might need…
*   **CTRL+W**: Closes the current tab you’re looking at. Be careful, closing the last tab shuts down FireFox!
*   **Preloading Pages**: I like to read stuff right through to the end before reading material that’s been linked to in the post. To have all the material ready and waiting, I middle click each of the links as I browse and they load up in new tabs while I’m reading.
*   **Bookmarking**: If you’re old school and insist on bookmarking, CTRL+D will bookmark the page you’re on. Actually, I’m using the [Del.icio.us Bookmarks extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/add-to-delicious/) for FireFox and CTRL+D brings up a new bookmark in that too! Hooray!

Conclusion
----------

Well, the conclusion is that I am a FireFox ninja! Most of these tricks should work in Internet Explorer, only a few work in Opera (unfortunately). If you’re a Flock fan, everything should work as I foretold it. Nonetheless, learning them has improved my web browsing experience no end. Over to you. Care to share any Power User tips for FireFox?
