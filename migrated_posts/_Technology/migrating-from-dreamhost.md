Well, after my well-documented gripes with Dreamhost, I've started to pull the plug. I've signed up for the Media Temple Grid Server service, which will comfortably combine all my domains (up to 100 sites, actually) under one account. Fantastic! Anyway, I've taken the liberty of [writing up a little instructional](http://www.interwebworld.co.uk/57/moving-wordpress-from-dreamhost-to-media-temples-grid-server/) for those who are considering moving away from Dreamhost too.
