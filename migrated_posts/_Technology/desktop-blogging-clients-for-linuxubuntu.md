[![Ubuntu logo](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/02/ubuntu-logo.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/02/ubuntu-logo.jpg)I installed a dual-boot configuration during a system rebuild recently and stuck the latest and greatest version of Ubuntu 8.10 on a sizeable partition. If you've been reading this blog for a while, you'll know that I'm constantly questioning whether Ubuntu Linux is a viable Windows replacement. One of the key things for me in making a transition of this magnitude is finding a desktop blogging client compatible with Linux and it also being as fully featured as Windows Live Writer - my blogging client of choice and perhaps the leading blog client software. The thing is, the latest version of Live Writer Beta has some pretty hot features, including a link gloassary which allows you to autolink to a page previously linked to: you enter the last anchor text as previously and it automatically creates the link for you. There isn't a single other blog editor that I know of that can replicate that functionality.  I took a look around for a bespoke blogging client for Linux. The state of the 'market' is pretty poor - the main players have little to no modern functionality, and other bloggers [have complained](http://www.labnol.org/software/download/best-desktop-blogging-clients-linux/3491/) about the [lack of development](http://linuxtidbits.wordpress.com/2008/01/14/a-look-into-linux-blogging-software/) in this area. I have a feeling that [KBlogger](http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=29552) might be an improvement, but haven't yet checked it out.

The Serious Contenders
----------------------

As it stands, I'm currently drafting this post in ScribeFire for FireFox. It's not a bad editor: supports Drupal and WordPress, sends pings on posting, has tagging and categorisation support. Neat stuff - embedding from YouTube and Flickr. The hyperlink tool automatically pastes in the most recent URL in the clipboard. Flock is a decent option as well. It's not the best option out there, and I can't seem to find it under the Synaptic Package Manager, which means you'll have to download it from the Flock website and do a manual install. (**Update:** Flock is no longer available. Sorry.) The holy grail, of course, would be to get Windows Live Writer working under Ubuntu. Tried this using WINE, but apparently it's not going to happen. Well, not unless I do a Virtualbox install, stick Windows XP on it and run Live Writer seamlessly. However, this would open up the path for running Photoshop in Ubuntu and some of the other apps that have me lingering in Windows. If I go this route, I'll definitely share my notes for getting Live Writer/Virtualbox installed. Are you using a desktop blog client in Ubuntu? If so, share here what you're using and how it's working out for you.
