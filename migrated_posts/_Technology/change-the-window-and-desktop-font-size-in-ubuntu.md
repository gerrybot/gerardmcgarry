[![Ubuntu logo](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/02/ubuntu-logo.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/02/ubuntu-logo.jpg) Something that bugs me in Ubuntu is the default text size for window titles and desktop icons - it's far too big. How do you change it? Well, in Ubuntu 8.10, you browse to the **System** -\> **Preferences** -\> **Appearance** programme, and on the **Fonts** tab, you should be able to set the font size to your liking. I shrunk the font down to 8. I think this is pretty readable and saves a bit of space on screen. Of course, while you're in the **Appearance** programme, you can modify the actual display fonts for your screen _and_ whether they're bold or italic. There you go, another quick tip. Hope this helps some of you out.
