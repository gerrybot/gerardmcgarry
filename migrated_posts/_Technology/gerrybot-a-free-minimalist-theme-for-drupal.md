[![Gerrybot theme for Drupal](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/03/gerrybot.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2010/03/gerrybot.jpg) I promised a while back that I would make the theme I use on this site available for free download. Well, here it is. Called **GerryBot**, it'sÂ  a very minimalist one-column Drupal 6 theme. The original concept behind this theme was to have _as little as possible_ on the page to distract from the content. Some of the features are:

*   Single column design, but with support for blocks in the sidebar underneath the logo.
*   Only two regions for blocks - in the sidebar area or underneath the content. Remember, the goal is to reduce on-page clutter.
*   Primary links at top of page, secondary links at the footer of the page.
*   Content area is 500px wide, uses 14px font size for good legibility. Body is a subtle grey shade, and the inner content area is white to focus the eye on the article.
*   Based on a [960 Grid layout](http://960.gs/).

Now, the theme is in '_beta mode_' at the moment. I've never packaged a Drupal theme before, so I really would appreciate your feedback.

Installation
------------

Usual Drupal theme installation advice applies:

*   Unzip the archive and upload the **gerrybot** folder to your Drupal site to sites/*/themes
*   Log on to Drupal as the administrator, go to **Site Building** -\> **Themes**. Activate the theme (set it as default too) and then click **Save Configuration**.
*   Visit the homepage of your site and the GerryBot theme should now be applied.

Feedback
--------

Whether it's aesthetic details of the theme - font-sizes, colours of links, etc, or if GerryBot is missing support for common styling elements that occur in Drupal. Just let me know - either in the comments to this page, or use my [contact form](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/about/ "About").
