I like to exist on the bleeding edge, and I'm waiting with baited breath for the next version of Drupal to be released. My memory of the last **big** Drupal release - migrating from version 5 to 6 - was a frustrating affair. Though the new core code was available, very few of the contributed modules were available at the time Drupal 6 came out. The reason for writing this is because I came across this blog post on Mikkel HÃ¸gh's blog, where he talks about [supporting Drupal by adopting the latest version](http://mikkel.hoegh.org/blog/2009/aug/27/going-edge-drupal-7/) as soon as possible. Now, even though that's quite an old post, I admire the principle - upgrade as quickly as possible and help move the Drupal project along. I'm keen to jump on board with the latest version. There are sites in production that I can afford to experiment with and one's where I'll adopt a "wait and see" attitude, or perform some more in-depth testing first. Since this is my personal site, it's the least reliant on contributed modules, but still taps into some of the main ones. Imagecache, CCK, Views, Pathauto, etc. I've high hopes that most of these will be available on the day that Drupal 7 goes live. I'll probably do an upgrade test first - taking a database dump and running the various upgrades on a test server. My bigger concern will be a few sites I have hanging off a multisite installation which use a range of different modules. That'll be a head scratcher. All the same, I've got full confidence there'll be a great new version of Drupal out soon and it'll work just fine in production! I'm especially looking forward to new, more granular themes and I _really_ want to test Drupal with Varnish cache to see what it does for performance. Anyone else planning on moving to the latest whenever Drupal 7 becomes available?
