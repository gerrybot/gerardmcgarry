Trust me, it's well hidden! I initially went looking through the Nexus settings, but had no luck. Guess what? Once you discover where to look, setting up multiple alarms on the Nexus is actually a doddle. Let me talk you through it! These instructions should hold steady on any Nexus device, though I'm using a Nexus 7 with Android 4.3.

Set up your first alarm
-----------------------

[![The Nexus Clock App](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2013/11/Clock-App.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2013/11/Clock-App.jpg) Click on the clock at the top of your home screen. This should take you into the clock config screen. (Alternatively, click the "All Apps" button - the circle on the bottom of your home screen - and then open the **Clock** app from there.) Next, click on the alarm clock icon in the lower left corner. This should bring up the following screen. It may contain a preconfigured alarm, or it may be empty.

You should then see the following screen: [![Alarm app - setting the time](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2013/11/Alarm-Time-Set.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2013/11/Alarm-Time-Set.jpg) Simply use the numberpad to type in the exact time you want to be woken up at. There are a couple of shortcuts for :00 and :30 which might come in handy. ClickÂ **OK** when you're done. That completes the basic alarm setup, but you can choose the ringtone and the repeat settings for the alarm in the following screen: [![Alarm repeat settings on Nexus](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2013/11/Alarm-Repeat.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2013/11/Alarm-Repeat.jpg) You may also set a label for the alarm, however unlike the IOS alarm app, this isn't displayed prominently, so it may not be of much help to you. If you want to add a label anyway, click into that field and type a name for the alarm. That's it, you're done!

Disabling an alarm
------------------

If you want to temporarily disable an alarm (say you're on holiday for a week and you want to lie in), you can simply toggle the on-off switch at the right hand side of the alarm. See the photo below: [![Alarm configuration screen on Android 4.3](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2013/11/Alarm-Conf.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2013/11/Alarm-Conf.jpg)

Deleting an alarm
-----------------

Deleting an alarm on the Nexus is easy - you simply hold your finger on the alarm you want to delete. This should highlight the entry in blue, then the top toolbar will display a trash can icon. Click the trash can and your alarm will be deleted.
