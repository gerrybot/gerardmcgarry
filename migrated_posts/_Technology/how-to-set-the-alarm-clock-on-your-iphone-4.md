Ever wondered how to **set the alarm clock** on your iPhone? I got one at Christmas and spent ages browsing through the settings looking for the alarm setup. It turns out that the clock's where the configuration settings are. On my iPhone the clock's inside the Utilities folder. [![iPhone utilities folder](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/01/IMG_0048.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/01/IMG_0048.jpg) Here's the alarm config screen - I've already added an alarm in this example, but you can add a new alarm by clicking the plus button on the top right hand side.

Never overboil an egg again! Here's the **Add Alarm**Â screen - you can configure the time of the alarm, the ringtone to use and a bunch of other options.

You need to click each day individually.

The hardest part was finding where the clock programme was in the first place!
