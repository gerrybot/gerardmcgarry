![Chrome with a mis-spelled autocorrect entry](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2014/02/chrome-autocomplete-url.jpg) Here's an annoying thing that Google Chrome does: if you type in a URL that contains a spelling mistake, it will actually hold on to that entry and present it as an autocomplete suggestion the next time you start typing in that address. In the screenshot above, I've typed in a web address incorrectly. What I'm actually looking for is interwebworld.co.uk. Unfortunately, the next time I start to type 'interw...', the incorrect version of the address will pop up. And the more you accidentally hit the incorrect version, the more more Chrome will continue to present this entry. You need to delete it. But how? It's actually quite easy - one simple keyboard combination should wipe this nuisance autocomplete entry from your life forever - or until the next time you type the address incorrectly! Here's a step-by-step guide:

1.  In Chrome, start typing the incorrect web address until it shows up in the address bar.
2.  Use your arrow keys to select the entry from the drop-down list.
3.  Press **fn**, **shift** and the **backspace** (delete) key simultaneously. The  entry should disappear from the list. Test this by trying to type the address again - this time the incorrect entry should be gone completely.

And that's it. I've tested this in OS X Mountain Lion and Mavericks and it works pretty well. Let me know if it helps you out.

Windows users

I'm told that the equivalent keyboard combination - if you're on Windows - is to simply press **shift** and **delete**.
