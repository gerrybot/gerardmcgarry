If you're migrating to Mac OS X from Windows, you might be looking for a shortcut to lock your screen. This is a two-part fix: first you have to require a password to unlock the screen, then you have to learn the shortcut to lock your screen on-demand.

Require password to unlock
--------------------------

Browse to **Security & Privacy** and load the **General **tab. Make sure the **Require password** option is ticked (as in the image above). You can configure this to ask for the password immediately after the screen sleeps. Personally, I prefer to leave a few seconds grace for those occasions the screensaver activates by accident.

Lock the screen whenever you want
---------------------------------

Now, if you're leaving your MacBook unattended, you can lock the screen with a keyboard shortcut combo. Use the shortcuts below depending on your model of Mac.

*   If your Mac has an Eject key or an external keyboard, use **Control+Shift+Eject**.
*   If you have a MacBook Air or a retina MacBook Pro, use **Control+Shift+Power Button**.

The screensaver should automatically activate. When you try to reactivate the MacBook using either the mousepad or the keyboard, you should be prompted for a password. Now, test that out a couple of times to make sure it works.

Why bother with locking your screen?
------------------------------------

If you work in a shared space - or you're simply worried about getting fraped by an over-zealous family member - locking your screen is essential. Getting into the habit of locking your computer when you're away from it protects it from prying eyes. It's great security practise. For a little bit of additional protection, you can add a message to your lock screen. It can be a good idea to leave contact details so if the machine gets stolen or misplaced, you can be reached by whoever finds it. You can set this up from the same **Security & Privacy** area in **System Preferences**.
