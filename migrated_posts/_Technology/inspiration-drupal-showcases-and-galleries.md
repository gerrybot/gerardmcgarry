[![Drupal Logo](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/01/drupal-logo.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2011/01/drupal-logo.jpg)I've got a couple of [Drupal](http://drupal.org/) sites I'm planning to tidy up and work on over the coming months. Ideas for these sites are currently in flux, so I'm looking around to see other sites running on Drupal, what their features are and how they've been structured and designed. As part of my research, I've dug out some galleries that showcase live Drupal websites. Some of these contain excellent screenshots, others merely link to the sites in question. However, if you want to see the breadth of what Drupal can do, and you want to look at real-world solutions, these are great places to start. I _have_ listed these posts/sites in order of preference, so hopefully you'll hit the most useful resources first. And if you know of any other Drupal showcases that deserve a mention here, leave me a comment and I'll update this post.

1.  **The Ultimate Drupal Showcase**: A tastefully laid-out gallery, arranged by category and showing screenshots of each site. Sites are grouped by type: Business, Media, Non-Profit, Governmental sites. Larger screenshots and links to each site are also available.
2.  [**31 Remarkable Drupal Powered Websites**](http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/31-drupal-content-management-system-cms/): A diverse collection of screenshots showing different types of Drupal site. A slightly older gallery, but has some good examples of Drupal websites.
3.  [**Drupal Sites spotted by Dries Buytaert**](http://buytaert.net/tag/drupal-sites): The founder of the Drupal project likes to point his readers toward new implementations of Drupal spotted in the wild. Loads of government and media sites in here, including a load of big name pop and rock stars are featured.
4.  [**Showcase of Popular Websites developed using Drupal**](http://artatm.com/2010/02/showcase-of-popular-website-developed-using-drupal/): Good sized screenshots of a wide range of Drupal sites. This one stands out for being annotated quite well and has links to the sites they've featured.
5.  [**Drupal Based**](http://drupalbased.com/): A site devoted to showcasing Drupal in the wild. Not a great user experience, I'm afraid. The thumbnails are too small to be useful, and you have to click through to the individual page for each site to get more useful information.

P.S. [The Onion](http://www.theonion.com/), the popular satirical news website, is no longer a Drupal site. The developers decided to migrate to Django, as expained in [this post on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/bhvhz/the_onion_uses_django_and_why_it_matters_to_us).
