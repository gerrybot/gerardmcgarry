As you know, I’ve been getting to grips with [CentOS](http://www.centos.org), the Community ENTerprise Operating System. Another little foible that CentOS inherits from Red Hat Enterprise is that it doesn’t include native support for MP3 playback. Again, down to legality/licensing issues. Damn those lawyers! I did a bit of searching around, and there are a couple of fixes/work-arounds available to enable MP3 support in CentOS Linux. The one which worked out of the box for me was the [XMMS MP3 plugin](http://www.gurulabs.com/goodies/downloads.php) at Guru Labs. For my version of CentOS, I took an educated guess and installed the files for Red Hat Linux 9. This was a straight RPM package which I downloaded and installed. Immediately afterward, the XMMS program was able to play my MP3 collection [from my NTFS partition](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/2008/hacking-centos-for-ntfs-support/ "Hacking CentOS For NTFS Support")! I’m starting to enjoy this Linux stuff!
