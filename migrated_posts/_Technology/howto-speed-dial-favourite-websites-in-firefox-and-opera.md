[![Firefox Logo](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/08/firefox-e1379623063857.jpg)](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/files/2009/08/firefox-e1379623063857.jpg)Mozilla FireFox and [Opera](http://www.opera.com) both have a nifty bookmarks feature which allows you to give a bookmark a shortcut, sort of like speed-dial for websites. Here’s how it works: Browse to a website you visit often, say this one. Bookmark the site by either pressing CTRL+D or going to **Bookmarks** / **Bookmark** this page.  Once you’ve bookmarked the page, go to the **Bookmarks** menu and locate your new bookmark. Now, right-click on the bookmark and choose **Properties**. Under the usual title and URL fields, you’ll see a **Keyword** field. Type ‘gerard’ as your keyword (assuming you’re bookmarking my site!) and click **OK**. Now, click into the location bar, type **gerard** and hit return on your keyboard. The shortcut is instantly transformed into the URL!

Using Nicknames In Opera
------------------------

As I said, Opera has offered the same functionality for a while now, allows you to assign the keyword at the time you create the bookmark. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

*   Bookmark a site in Opera (mine, obviously).
*   When the **Add Bookmark** dialog appears, find the Nickname field and assign the shortcut you want to use. Test it out by clicking into the location bar, typing the nickname and hitting Return on your keyboard.
*   Done!

It’s not practical to use this for every website you bookmark. I tend to use it for sites I hit frequently to save me typing in long URLs over and over again.
