A new version of [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) is always an exciting occassion: the release schedule is always _way_ more frequent than Windows, and there's always some fascinating development that makes the upgrade worth your while. So, tonight I'm upgrading my older version of Ubuntu from 8.10 to the latest release, which is 9.04. Otherwise known as Jaunty Jackalope, although the emphasis on animal names seems to be significantly played down on this version. With this edition, the upgrade process is its easiest **ever**. Here's a quick step-by-step showing you how to upgrade your version of Ubuntu over the Internet:

1.  Go to **System** -\> **Administration** -\> **Update Manager**
2.  Press the **Check** button to scan for updated packages
3.  Above the recommended updates area, you should see a notice telling you that a new release of Ubuntu is abailable. Click the **Upgrade** button and then follow the simple wizard to begin upgrading your machine.

As I type this, I'm busily upgrading my version of Ubuntu - I'll see you on the other side with a report on how it went! **Update:** Upgrading took roughly an hour to download and install the new version. The new login screens are very sexy, and I've just posted a tutorial showing how to [install a GDM login theme](http://gerard.interwebworld.co.uk/2009/how-to-install-an-ubuntu-gdm-login-theme/). OpenOffice 3 is now installed, the latest version of FireFox too. All my Compiz settings are working fine - nothing appears to be broken!
