You know what would be handy in Mac OS X? If you were able to activate Launchpad with a keyboard shortcut. But for some reason, that's not how it works on my MacBook. (**Update**: in later versions of Mac OS X, the F4 key will bring up the Launchpad menu.) But there's light at the end of the tunnel. You can _assign a shortcut key_ for Launchpad very easily. Simply open your System Preferences and click the Keyboard item. It should start in Mission Control, but flick to Launchpad & Dock and you should see an option to Show Launchpad. [![Setting a keyboard shortcut for Launchpad](http://interwebworld.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Launchpad-Keyboard-Shortcut.png "Setting a keyboard shortcut for Launchpad")](http://interwebworld.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Launchpad-Keyboard-Shortcut.png) There should be a blank space beside this option. Click into that and then press the key combination you want to assign to the shortcut. I used COMMAND+SHIFT+L. The setting should be activated right away, so pressing your chosen combination should bring up Launchpad. Pressing it again will dismiss Launchpad. Does that help anybody?
