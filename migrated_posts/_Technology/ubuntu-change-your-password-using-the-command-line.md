Well, using the command line, it's actually quite easy... I'm going through a process of changing my various computer and web passwords. After the much publicised vulnerabilities with Google and MSN a few weeks ago, I thought it might be a good time to change my passwords. Now, to change your password through the command line, you simply type in **passwd** and hit return. You'll be prompted to enter your current password first, then your new password twice. It's that easy.

A GUI Password Change?
----------------------

I decided to do a little digging around to see if there was a GUI option to change your password. After all, how much use if Ubuntu for regular users if they can't accomplish basic security tasks? Surprisingly, the GUI to change password can be found in **System** -\> **Preferences** -\> **About Me**. When you bring up this dialog, there's a **Change Password** button in the right hand corner. Follow the prompts and you'll achieve exactly the same thing as if you'd used the command line.
