![Mac OS DVD autoplay settings](http://gerard.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/dvd-autoplay.jpg) One annoying aspect of Mac OS X is the way is automatically launches the DVD player whenever you insert a DVD in the drive. You might not be ready to watch the movie right away or you may be planning to make a backup of the disc [using Handbrake](http://handbrake.fr/) or something else. You can easily disable the autoplay feature on your MacBook. Follow these simple step-by-step instructions:

1.  Click the Apple icon at the top of your screen and open the **System Preferences** applet. Browse to **CDs and DVDs**.
2.  In the **When you insert a video DVD** section, set it to **Ignore**. This will stop the MacBook autoplaying media, leaving you to choose which application to launch.
3.  Alternatively, if you want to use a different programme to view DVDs, drop down the menu and choose **Open other application**. Browse for the application you want.
4.  Close the **System Preferences** applet when you're finished. Job done.

While you're browsing the DVD and CD settings, you can also play around with the settings for music and photo discs. But does anybody actually use those things anymore?
