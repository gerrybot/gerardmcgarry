[![Nginx logo](http://www.interwebworld.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/nginx-logo.png "Nginx Logo")](http://www.interwebworld.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/nginx-logo.png)I did it. This experiment started a couple of days ago when I decided to set up a server using Nginx and PHP-FPM as an alternative to Apache. We keep hearing about the benefits of Nginx and how it does a fantastic job of producing PHP based files and thereafter serving static cached versions of the pages. I've installed this based on the series of tutorials that I've written about [building a functioning Nginx server](http://gerardmcgarry.com/blog/installing-nginx-a-media-temple-ve-server).
