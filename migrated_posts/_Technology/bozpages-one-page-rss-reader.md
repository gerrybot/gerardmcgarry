[Bozpages](http://sandbox.sourcelabs.com/bozpage/) aren't unique. A webpage that displays a list of recent posts in RSS feeds? Why not use [Netvibes](http://www.netvibes.com)? Or the [Google Personalised Homepage](http://www.google.com/ig)?  
  
Well, the Google IG page is as ugly as hell, for a start! Personally, I swear by Netvibes, because it gives me my [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/scribble-designs/) galleries, my del.icio.us bookmarks and my gmail _as well as the ability to add RSS feeds_.  
  

So, why use Bozpages?
---------------------

  
  
There's no reason at all, really. [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com) have just launched their favourites service which does pretty much the same thing - a river of posts syphoned off your favourite blogs. ([Mine's here](http://www.technorati.com/faves/scribbleDesigns))  
  
Having said that, I love the design of Bozpages. Good whitespace. The page isn't too cramped, and the title elements use some fresh colours.  
  
I've been using it for a couple of days as a portal for some of my own blogs and sites I look after. It's definitely a nice interface, although it needs some work on the usability front, as it's severely lacking in on-screen documentation! You need to visit the [Bozpages Wiki](http://swik.net/BozPages) for more information. [My Bozpage](http://sandbox.sourcelabs.com/bozpage/?hb7) is here.
