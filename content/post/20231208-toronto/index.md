_For the past couple of years, an idea has been bubbling at the back of my mind: What if you could live and work somewhere else in the world?_
<!--more-->

It was actually on my list of goals for this year, almost forgotten due to lack of time and opportunity. Then, in the middle of November, the stars aligned: there was a need to go and work with a team in Canada, and would I mind flying over in the next couple of days? 

So the destination was Toronto. The duration was two weeks. Serendipitously, I was heading to Dublin for a Greta Van Fleet gig already, so I just packed The Big Case and flew out the next day.

Toronto is a city of contrasts - gleaming high towers sit alongside ramshackle timber frame houses. Pristine city streets and lots of construction signal a town literally on the rise. And yet, at the same time, largely invisible during the day, homeless people position themselves at night on street vents in the middle of sidewalks, hoping to catch the heat from the steam rising from beneath.

The city was beginning to light up with gigantic Christmas decorations, trees and even a massive ScotiaBank moose. Nathan Phillips Square (where the iconic Toronto sign lives) was being filled with festive amusements and a small ice rink. At the same time, the streets of Toronto were periodically disrupted by protests in favour of either Israel or Palastine depending on the day. 

While my time in Toronto was marked mostly by some intensive project work, I managed to get some downtime and explore the city, both with colleagues and solo. Many photos were taken. Many more of the CN Tower (which should never be referred to as 'that big space needle thing').
