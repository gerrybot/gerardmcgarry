## I went on a yoga retreat

Random serendipity struck as a friend sent me details of a yoga retreat in Sweden in May 2019. I signed up on the basis that a yoga retreat was definitely a new thing for me. Visiting Sweden was a new thing. And the cooking would be entirely vegan which was something I was trying to improve on. And of course, the opportunity to meet a bunch of new people!

## Fair Head, Ballycastle

In April 2019, I took a friend for a walk along the top of Fair Head, just outside Ballycastle. It's a place I return to fairly frequently for dramatic views over Rathlin Island and rugged coastline. The wind on this particular day was fierce and it was like being shoved around by invisible hands. I just loved this shot for its bleak colours and that impassive rock face staring eternally out to sea.
