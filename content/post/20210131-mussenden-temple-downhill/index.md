No visit to Northern Ireland is complete without a stop at Downhill Demesne and it's iconic monument, Mussenden Temple. 

_The lure of an abandoned house is in **not** knowing the story of the people who lived there. Imagining the people who lived there. What their lives were like. Why they left behind their home and where they went to next. But with this place, I knew the people well._

My father's aunt and uncle, Tom and Eileen lived in this place with their daughter Shiela until the roof literally started caving in. It had no plumbing that I know of, no electricity, and their only source of entertainment was a battery-powered radio.

Lucretius: 

Suave, mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis
e terra magnum alterius spectare laborem."
"Tis pleasant, safely to behold from shore
The troubled sailor, and hear the tempests roar."

Mrs Frideswide Mussenden - Bishop's cousin - he named the temple after her

I intend to build a Grecian temple in Frideswide's honour...I intend to build it on the edge of a cliff. It will give employment to the poor, to the district and employment.
