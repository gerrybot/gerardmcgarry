      <description>&lt;p&gt;Life comes at you fast. At the start of 2020, the world had never heard of Coronavirus. By March, terms like &amp;ldquo;social distancing&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;flattening the curve&amp;rdquo; were part of everyday conversation. We entered nationwide lockdown, keeping to our houses as much as possible and watched anxiously for news of the virus at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The impact of this pandemic is almost impossible to comprehend. International travel at a virtual standstill. Populations voluntarily staying at home. Businesses going on hiatus, except those that are truly critical. The self-employed and gig economy are suffering the worst since they have scant protection against a disaster on this scale. Massive economic disruption. Stock markets tanking hard. Governments forced into providing universal aid.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
